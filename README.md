# Introduction to my Perception Test

<html><h3>This is one of my Java assignments in my first Java class. I like this one a lot because this is the first time I 
 changed from console to pop-up window(a bit of GUI) and used a tiny bit of HTML.</h3>
  
Perception Test simply is just a guessing game. This program uses a standard Zener Deck. "Zener cards are cards used to conduct 
experiments for extra sensory perception (ESP) or clairvoyance. These were heavily used in the 60â€™s with results published in 
several papers written to support the existence of ESP." It's simply an experiment to see if you can percept right or wrong what's on the card. <^-^>!

"A zener card deck is made up of 25 cards that consist of five cards of each 5 shapes. The image above shows the five 
shapes. We will add the feature of five colors so that no shape and color combination is repeated. For example, there will be 
a circle in all five colors, a square in all five colors, etc."

<h3>So, instead of working with the above Zener Deck which my professor provided us. I came up with my own Zener Desk equivalent to that. It took me 
a whole night to design my own set of 25 cards of 5 childhood cartoon characters: Tom cat, Jerry mouse, Donald duck, Mickey mouse and Pooh bear doing 
5 different activities: eat, sleep, smile, cry and run. I love them though, they looks very cute!</h3>

+ There are total three tests that user can pick one: Character test(percept characters), Activity test(percept activities) or Both test(percept both).
  User also have option to quit:

+ Once user picked a test, the program will generate a random card and let user guess:

+ Each test contains standard 5 trials(means guessing 5 cards), each time user guess right, the score increase one. User can quit after receive score or can keep have another 5 trials if wants to:

+ If user wants to continue another 5 trials(always same test), the score will be added up:
